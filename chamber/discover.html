                <h3>Popay치n "The white city"</h3><br>
                <p>On 13 January 1537, the Spanish conqueror, Sebasti치n de Belalc치zar arrived in Popay치n. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Popay치n was administered by an appointed governor under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audience of Quito, part of the Viceroyalty of Peru. </p>
                <p>The town is well known for its colonial architecture and its contributions to Colombian cultural and political life. It is also known as the "white city" due to the color of most of the colonial buildings in the city center, where several churches are located, such as San Francisco, San Jos칠, Bel칠n, Santo Domingo, San Agust칤n, and the Catedral Bas칤lica Nuestra Se침ora de la Asunci칩n, known locally as "La Catedral". The city's cathedral was home to the Crown of the Andes, a 16th-century Marianist devotional object featuring emeralds taken from the captured Inca Emperor Atahualpa. It was sold to finance local health care institutions. </p>
                <!-- <p>Popay치n was a very important city due to its location between Lima, Quito and Cartagena. Even after the discovery of the Pacific Ocean, Popay치n remained a transfer point for gold and other riches going to Cartagena on their way to Spain. Popay치n also served as a colonial mine, and produced various denominations of gold escudo coins and silver reales from 1760 through 1819; it continued producing coinage for the new Republic of Colombia after 1826.</p> -->

                <h3>Holy Week</h3><br>
                <p>Popay치n is widely known for the solemnity of its Holy Week processions, during which it commemorates the passion and death of Jesus Christ. Since roughly the mid-sixteenth century - documents in the historical archives of Popay치n mention processions in the year 1558 - sacred processions have taken place each night from Tuesday until Holy Saturday, with ancient religious images paraded through Popay치n's historical downtown streets</p> 
                <p>These processions represent episodes from the Gospels, relating the Passion, crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Each representation is called a "Paso". Since the time of the conquest the pasos have been carried through the streets on the shoulders of the traditional 'cargueros' in a route shaped like a cross, which takes in the main churches and temples of the city. Since 2009 the Popay치n Holy Week processions have been inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.</p>

                <h3>Humilladero Bridge</h3><br>
                <p>This bridge connects the central and northern zones of the city. It was built in 1873 on arches of brick and masonry. The designs were prepared by the Italian friar Fray Serafin Barbetti and a German engineer whose mummified remains are preserved in the Archdiocesan Museum of Religious Art. The bridge crosses a fault between the city center and the El Callej칩n (now Bolivar) neighborhood which was previously extremely difficult to cross, requiring pedestrians to almost crawl on their knees. Accordingly, the new bridge was named Humilladero.</p> 
                <p>For a long time this bridge was one of the main entrances to the city. The liberating armies crossed it to enter Popay치n during the early stages of the struggle for Colombia independence. Its well-planned design and strong construction has allowed the bridge to remain intact through many earthquakes.</p>

                <h3>Gastronomy</h3><br>
                <p> Popay치n has been declared a City of Gastronomy by UNESCO, in tribute to its significant tradition of regional cooking.  Typical dishes of the city are a legacy of both Spanish and indigenous cultural interaction, integrating components of local origin with fruits brought from Spain. </p>
                <p>The National Gastronomy Congress of Popay치n has been held each September since 2003, and in 2005 was recognized by UNESCO as a cultural heritage event of the United Nations creative network. The Congress is organized by the Gastronomic Corporation of Popay치n, which has presented seven events which have also featured the participation of various countries as special guests: Peru, Brazil, Spain, Chile, Mexico, Italy and France. </p>
